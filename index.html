      Household EdConnect Program Enrollment Status, Reduced Lunch Status and
      BIPOC Distribution by Year
    </h2>
    <div class="main-container">

        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
          In a world entrenched in a constant debate regarding race, income and
          equality, it is more important than ever to understand the
          relationship between these three sectors of society. In this analysis,
          an examination is done on the HCS EdConnect internet broadband
          initiative in the local community of Chattanooga, Tennessee. The
          dataset provided statistics from the outcomes of household surveys,
          which included household demographics such as the race of the children
          in families, the household’s status for free/reduced lunch, and,
          subsequently, the household’s enrollment in the HCS EdConnect program.
          The household’s enrollment in the EdConnect initative is directly
          correlated to their status in the free/reduced lunch program because
          eligibility for the internet broadband service was dependent on a
          family’s economic status. The data presented in these charts show the
          relationships between race, or in the naming convention of the
          dataset/survey, “BIPOC Status,” and their enrollment in a free lunch
          program as well as in the HCS EdConnect program itself.
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology:</h2>
        <p>
          There is a brushable scatter-plot on the right where each point
          represents every family that had a response to questions regarding
          their demographics in the survey. Since the IDs that were already
          incorporated into the dataset ranged too significantly in numbers, the
          X and Y axes were created from generating numbers and assigning them
          to each row in the dataset. That way, it was plausible to map out
          every single datapoint on a scatter-plot. In order to maintain
          integrity of the data, these numbers were generated at random and
          every point was mapped to look identical, so users are not influenced
          by color or size when they brush to select families.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first stacked bar chart shows the relationship between a
          household’s enrollment status in the EdConnect program and their race
          demographic. The dataset categorized families into two sectors: “<span
            class="highlight-trigger"
            data-highlight-class="white"
            >All White</span
          >” and “<span class="highlight-trigger" data-highlight-class="bipoc"
            >At Least One BIPOC child</span
          >.” The breakdown of the brushed over families into these two
          categories can be seen in the pie chart below the stacked bar chart.
          Noticeably, regardless of the number of families brushed over, there
          is a consistent pattern of a higher percentage of BIPOC families that
          are enrolled in the EdConnect Program than families categorized as All
          White.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second stacked bar chart represents the percentage of free/reduced
          lunch status compared to all paid lunch status between All White
          categorized families and families with at least one BIPOC child. It is
          a little less evident, but nonetheless still true, that there is a
          higher percentage of free/reduced lunch BIPOC families among all BIPOC
          families than there are for white families with the same status among
          all white families.
        </p>

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          Although this data is nowhere near enough to make concrete
          conclusions, it does display a pattern that seems to be recurring
          throughout all of the United States. We’re seeing a

          perpetuates this cycle. It is more important than ever to actively
          participate in politics and demonstrate to lawmakers the change that
          is necessary. For more information, visit
